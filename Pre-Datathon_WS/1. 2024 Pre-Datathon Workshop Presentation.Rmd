## Better Data Visualizations

Five guidelines for better data visualizations from Jon Schwabish's book called [Better Data Visualizations](https://policyviz.com/pv_books/better-data-visualizations-a-guide-for-scholars-researchers-and-wonks/).

* Show the data
* Reduce the clutter
* Integrate the graphics and text
* Avoid the spaghetti chart
* Start with gray

## Example: Urbana Police Incidents from 2010 - Feb 2023

Data Source: Urbana's Open Data website 

[Urbana Police Incidents Dataset Link](https://data.urbanaillinois.us/Police/Police-Incidents-from-1988-Feb-2023/uj4k-8xe8/about_data)

Police incidents from 1988 until February 2023, when the Urbana Police began using a new computer system. Records before 1988 are incomplete - and could be data entry errors. | MAPPING NOTE! Some addresses will not appear on maps because streets no longer exist or are not recognized by the mapping databases.

**In this workshop, we only use the data from 2010 to 2023.**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df1 <- read_csv("Urbana Police Incidents Data (2010-2014).csv")
df2 <- read_csv("Urbana Police Incidents Data (2015-2019).csv")
df3 <- read_csv("Urbana Police Incidents Data (2020-2023).csv")

df3$WEAPONS.CODE.1 <- as.character(df3$WEAPONS.CODE.1)

### Stack three data frames
UC <- bind_rows(df1, df2, df3)
```



## Guideline 1: Show the Data

>"Your reader can only grasp your point, argument, or story if they see the data. -- Jon Schwabish"

`r kableExtra::text_spec("Choose the right charts and graphs for the job", color = "#1696d2")`

* Visualizing Relationships: The Impact of **Scatterplots**
* Tracking Trends: The Impact of **Line Graphs**
* Comparing Multicategories: The Role of **Bar Charts**
* Exploring Data Clusters: Insights from **Histograms** and **Box Plots**

  - Histograms and box plots show where your data is clustered and can compare categories.

* Pie Charts: Enhancing Visualization Details

  - Pie charts are powerful for **adding** detail to other visualizations, but arenâ€™t as effective on their own.
  - Bar charts are favored over pie charts.

* More R chart examples can be find at [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)

## Guideline 1 Continue


`r kableExtra::text_spec("Hourly Trends in Crime Incidences", color = "#1696d2")`

<font color = "#55b748">Step 1:</font> Create a variable `Hour.occ` representing the hour when an incident occurred based on the value of `TIME.OCCURRED`.
<font color = "#55b748">Step 2:</font> Create a variable `WEAPON` representing if any weapon was used in that incident based on `WEAPON.1.DESCRIPTION`. 
```{r}

UC <- UC %>% 
  mutate(Hour.occ = hour(hms(TIME.OCCURRED)),
         WEAPON = case_when(
           is.na(WEAPON.1.DESCRIPTION) |
             WEAPON.1.DESCRIPTION %in% c("", "NONE", "UNARMED") ~"Non-Weapon",
           TRUE ~ "Weapon"))
```


<font color = "#55b748">Step 3:</font> Draw the line chart.Use `labs()` to add the x-label, y-label, and title. 

```{r}
UC %>% 
  count(Hour.occ, WEAPON) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour.occ, y = n, color=WEAPON)) + 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Hours of the Day",
       y="Total Number of Crime Incidences",
       title = "Hourly Trends in Crime Incidences")
```


## Guideline 2: Reduce the Clutter

> "The use of unnecessary visual elements distracts your reader from the central idea and clutters the page."

A few things to avoid:

* heavy tick marks and grid lines
* unnecessary 3d
* excessive text


Consider this image from Claus Wilke's [Fundamental's of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("www", "images", "titanic-3d-1.png"))

```

*How many passengers are in first class? How many male passengers are in 3rd class?* Let's recreate this plot without the gratuitous 3D. 


### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Titanic Example", color = "#1696d2")`

The titanic data set

```{r}
titanic <- tribble(
  ~Class, ~Sex, ~n,
  "1st class", "female passengers", 144,
  "1st class", "male passengers", 179,
  "2nd class", "female passengers", 106,
  "2nd class", "male passengers", 171, 
  "3rd class", "female passengers", 216,
  "3rd class", "male passengers", 493
)

```

Recreate the 3D plot in 2D.

```{r}
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800, 100)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_stack(0.5)) 
```

## Guideline 3: Integrate the Graphics and Text

1. Remove legends when possible and label data directly
2. Write an active title like a newspaper headline
3. Add explainers

`labs()` adds title, subtitle, caption, and tag to ggplot2 objects. It can also be used to overwrite x, y, and legend titles. Use NULL to remove a label entirely (not `""`).


`r kableExtra::text_spec("Visualizing Crime Incidence Throughout the Day", color = "#1696d2")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggtext)
UC <- UC %>% 
  mutate(Hour.occ = hour(hms(TIME.OCCURRED)),
         Time_of_Day = case_when(
           Hour.occ >0 & Hour.occ<=6 ~ "Early Morning",
           Hour.occ>6 & Hour.occ <=12 ~ "Morning",

           Hour.occ>18 & Hour.occ<=24 | Hour.occ ==0 ~ "Evening"
         ),
         Time_of_Day = factor(Time_of_Day,
            levels=c("Early Morning", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening")))


UC %>% 
  count(Time_of_Day, WEAPON) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Time_of_Day, y=n,  fill=WEAPON)) + 
  geom_col()+
  geom_text(aes(label = n),
            position = position_stack(0.5),
            color = "white",
            size=3)+
  labs(x = NULL, 
       y = NULL,
       fill = NULL,
       title = "Increased criminal <span style = 'color:#00BFC4;'>with weapon</span> and <span style = 'color:#F8766D;'>without weapon</span> activity during evening hours",

## Guideline 3 Continue

#### Steps for Graphing Trend of Crime Incidences Throughout the Day


<font color = "#55b748">Step 1:</font> Deal with time and date using functions from **lubridate** package

* `TIME.OCCURRED` is in the format `08:15:00`, which corresponds to hour:minute:second. Thus

```{r}
hms("08:15:00") # Transforms a character to specified number of hours, minutes, and seconds
hour(hms("08:15:00")) #Get hours component
```

* Similarly, we can get year, month, day information using `year(mdy())`. 
* `DATE.OCCURRED` is in the format "02/10/2010", which corresponds to month/day/year.

```{r}
mdy("02/10/2010")
year(mdy("02/10/2010"))
```

<font color = "#55b748">Step 2:</font> Create variable `Time_of_Day` with Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening categories.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UC <- UC %>% 
  mutate(Hour.occ = hour(hms(TIME.OCCURRED)),
         Time_of_Day = case_when(
           Hour.occ >0 & Hour.occ<=6 ~ "Early Morning",
           Hour.occ>6 & Hour.occ <=12 ~ "Morning",
           Hour.occ>12 & Hour.occ <=18 ~ "Afternoon",
           Hour.occ>18 & Hour.occ<=24 | Hour.occ ==0 ~ "Evening"
         ))
```


<font color = "#55b748">Step 3:</font> Specify the order of the levels for Time_of_Day.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Time_of_Day <- factor(Time_of_Day, 
              levels=c("Early Morning", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"))
```

<font color = "#55b748">Step 4:</font> Draw barplot for `Time_of_Day`. Add count on the bars using `geom_text(aes(label=n))` and adjust position, color, and font size.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UC %>%

            color = "white",
            size=3)
```


<font color = "#55b748">Step 5:</font> Add a newspaper like headline with labs(title = ``'').


<font color = "#55b748">Step 6:</font> Add the sources of the data with `caption = "Data from Urbana's Open Data website"` in labs().


<font color = "#55b748">Step 7:</font> Remove x and y labels and the legend title in labs(). Change `labs()` to the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
labs(x = NULL, 
       y = NULL,
       fill = NULL,
       title = "Increased criminal <span style = 'color:#00BFC4;'>with weapon</span> and <span style = 'color:#F8766D;'>without weapon</span> activity during evening hours",

       caption = "Data from Urbana's Open Data website")+
  theme_minimal()+  
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown(hjust = 0.5)) +
  guides(fill = "none")
```

<font color = "#55b748">Step 8:</font> Install ggtext with install.packages("ggtext") and load the package with library(ggtext).


<font color = "#55b748">Step 9:</font> Add the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theme_minimal() +  
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown())
```

<font color = "#55b748">Step 10:</font> Add guides(fill = "none") to remove the legend.


<font color = "#55b748">Put everything together.</font> 

```{r}
library(ggtext)
UC <- UC %>% 
  mutate(Hour.occ = hour(hms(TIME.OCCURRED)),
         Time_of_Day = case_when(
           Hour.occ >0 & Hour.occ<=6 ~ "Early Morning",

           Hour.occ>12 & Hour.occ <=18 ~ "Afternoon",
           Hour.occ>18 & Hour.occ<=24 | Hour.occ ==0 ~ "Evening"
         ),
         Time_of_Day = factor(Time_of_Day, 
         levels=c("Early Morning", "Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening")))

## Guideline 4: Avoid the Spaghetti Chart

>"Sometimes we face the challenge of including lots of data in a single graph but we don't need to try to pack everything into a single graph. 

Faceting or using small multiples is a useful way to de-clutter a busy data visualization. We've already encountered faceting multiple times because it is so natural in ggplot2. With effective small multiples, if a reader understand how to read one small multiple then they should understand how to read all of the multiples. Two tips:

1. Arrange the small multiples in a logical order
2. Use the same layout, size, font, and color in each small multiple

## Guideline 5: Start with Gray

>"Whenever you make a graph, start with all gray data elements. By doing so, you force yourself to be purposeful and strategic in your use of color, labels, and other elements."

[`library(gghighlight)`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gghighlight/vignettes/gghighlight.html) complements this idea of starting with gray.



`r kableExtra::text_spec("Cumulative Crime Incidence Example", color = "#1696d2")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gghighlight)

UC %>% 
  count(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION, YEAR.OCCURRED) %>%
  group_by(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION) %>% 
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(YEAR.OCCURRED, cumsum, color=CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)),
                     breaks = c(seq(2010, 2023, 1)),
                     limits = c(2009.5, 2023.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)),
                     breaks = seq(1,6,2) * 10000,
                     limits = c(0, 60000))+
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Cumulative Crime Incidence")+
  gghighlight(max(cumsum) > 10000)+
  theme_minimal()



```

#### Steps for Graphing Calculating Cumulative Crime Incidence

<font color = "#55b748">Step 1:</font> Compute the cumulative sum of each crime incidence type over the years.

```{r}
UC.cumsum <- UC %>% 
  count(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION, YEAR.OCCURRED) %>%
  group_by(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION) %>% 
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(n))
```


<font color = "#55b748">Step 2:</font> Create a line plot with `x = YEAR.OCCURRED`, `y = cumsum`, `group = CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION`, and geom_line()

```{r}
UC.cumsum %>% 
  ggplot(aes(YEAR.OCCURRED, cumsum, group =CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION))+
  geom_line()
```


**Note:** If we simply create a line graph with `color = CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION`, then

```{r}
UC.cumsum %>% 
  ggplot(aes(YEAR.OCCURRED, cumsum, color =CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE)
  
```

<font color = "#55b748">Step 3:</font> Add the following code to clean up the x-axis and y-axis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)),
                   breaks = c(seq(2010, 2023, 1)),
                   limits = c(2009.5, 2023.5)) +
scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)),
                   breaks = seq(1,6,2) * 10000,
                   limits = c(0, 60000))+
labs(x = "Year",
     y = "Cumulative Crime Incidence")
```


<font color = "#55b748">Step 4:</font> Suppose we want to highlight the three crime incidence types with the highest occurrences. We can use library(gghighlight). Switch *group* to *color* in your existing code and add `gghighlight(max(cumsum) > 10000)`.

<font color = "#55b748">Step 5:</font> Above the data viz, add `theme_minimal()`. Or run `theme_set(theme_minimal())`, which changes the default theme for the entire R session.

<font color = "#55b748">Put everything together.</font> 

```{r}
library(gghighlight)

UC %>% 
  count(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION, YEAR.OCCURRED) %>%
  group_by(CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION) %>% 
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(YEAR.OCCURRED, cumsum, color=CRIME.CATEGORY.DESCRIPTION))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.002, 0)),
                     breaks = c(seq(2010, 2023, 1)),
                     limits = c(2009.5, 2023.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.002)),
                     breaks = seq(1,6,2) * 10000,
                     limits = c(0, 60000))+
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Cumulative Crime Incidence")+
  gghighlight(max(cumsum) > 10000)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Main Takeaways

Five guidelines for better data visualizations

* Choose the right charts and graphs for the job. Show the information clearly is the key!
* Reduce the clutter and avoid 3D plots!
* Integrate the graphics and text in a smart and seamless manner.
* Avoid the spaghetti chart by faceting or using small multiples. 
* Start with gray, start from simple.
